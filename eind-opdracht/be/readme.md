# KlantenbeheerSysteem Backend

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)
- [Postgress 15](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

## Getting started
### Development
#### Postgress
Make sure you have Postgress installed locally and have a database called "kbs".

#### Running application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `src.main.java.kbs.Application` class from your IDE.
